## 🚀 Marketrix.ai — Let your software support itself  
Marketrix is a SaaS platform bringing **AI assistants** into any web-based application. It learns the app UI by simulating user behavior, embeds into the app as a widget, and delivers on-screen support to its users in three intelligent modes:
- **Tell** – In-app AI chat  
- **Show** – Contextual UI walkthrough overlays  
- **Do** – Automated task execution  

→ Enables **zero-ticket support** and **instant onboarding** for any web app.
